                Interviews
              </h2>
              <p>TEAM offers students the possibility to meet business representatives from a range of companies during a private conversation about jobs and future possibilities. This is a great way to establish a connection with the company of your choice, but should by no means be considered a job interview. Applications for the individual meetings will open in advance, and the meetings themselves take place during the fair, the 24-25th of September. Keep an eye out for information regarding application deadlines and companies that offer interviews!
