    <h1 class="title">Interviews</h1>

    <p>TEAM offers students the possibility to meet business representatives from a wide range of companies during a calm, private conversation about jobs and future possibilities. This is a great way to establish a connection with the company of your choice,
      but should by no means be considered a job interview. Applications for so called “mock interviews” will open in advance, and the interviews themselves take place during the fair. Keep an eye out for information regarding application deadlines and
      companies that offer interviews!</p>
    <br>
    <h1 class="title">Events</h1>

    <p>During the weeks leading up to the fair as well as during the fair itself, we will arrange events such as guest lectures, case solving competitions, workshops and more. Keep an eye out for information about events held in English!</p>
